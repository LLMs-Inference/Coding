Then, I should search for flights from major German cities to these destinations, checking prices. Budget is under 2000 euros for three days, so flight and hotel need to be reasonably priced. Maybe look for budget airlines like Ryanair or EasyJet. Also, hotels near the beach that are affordable—maybe 3 or 4 stars with good reviews.\n",
            "\n",
            "After gathering destinations, check flight prices for May (perhaps early booking is better). Then find hotels in those areas that fit the budget. Additionally, check if the total for flights and hotel for three days is under 2000 euros. Maybe split the budget into flights (say ~300-500 euro round trip) and hotel around 100-150 per night, so 300-450 for three nights. Maybe activities and food with the remaining.\n",
            "\n",

Then, scrape possible hotel options or search for hotel recommendations in those areas.\n",

            "Alright, let's tackle this holiday planning task step by step. The user wants a 3-day trip in Europe in May 2025 for under €2000, with specific flight and hotel recommendations, a warm destination, and a beach nearby. They're coming from Germany, so flights from major German airports need to be considered.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, looking at the initial memory blocks, there's already some setup: the main goals are outlined. The search tools have provided some results already. The first search for European coastal cities that are warm in May suggested Spain, Italy, Greece, Southern France, and mentions specific places like Formentera (Spain), Malta, Sicily, Crete, and Algarve. The second search about flights from Germany to Malta, Sicily, Crete, and Algarve in May 2025 shows some flight prices, like Eurowings offering flights to Malta starting at €119.99. The third search for hotels under €150/night in Southern Europe brings up options in Spain, including Tui Blue Nausicaa Beach By Louis Hotels and others on TripAdvisor.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, the key points here seem to be narrowing down destinations based on temperature, flight prices, and hotel availability. Next steps could involve scraping specific URLs provided in the search results to get exact flight and hotel details. For example, the Eurowings link for Malta flights at €119.99 might be worth checking. Similarly, the Tui Blue Nausicaa hotel could be a candidate. Also, the CN Traveller article lists Cyprus, Spain, and Malta as warm destinations, so scraping those articles might give more hotel options or specific beach recommendations.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, since the tool only allows three tool calls per round, I need to prioritize the most promising leads. The flight prices from Germany to Malta at €119.99 (Eurowings) and the hotel options in Spain mentioned on TripAdvisor (Tui Blue Nausicaa) seem like good starting points. Also, checking the specific hotel mentioned in the TripAdvisor result might give the pricing and availability details. Additionally, the Reddit thread about car-free destinations might have user recommendations that aren't available yet, so scraping that could help confirm destinations with good beach access and culture without needing a car.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, but the Reddit URL mentioned in Source 1 is about car-free destinations. The user didn't specifically mention no car, but since they want a beach near the hotel, maybe some destinations where everything is walkable would be better. So that Reddit URL could provide useful suggestions, maybe like Valencia or Barcelona, which have city beaches.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, next tools to call: scrape Eurowings flight page to confirm Malta flights from Germany (€119.99), scrape the TripAdvisor link for best beach hotels under €150, and maybe check the CN Traveller article for hotel recommendations. Alternatively, scraping the specific hotel link like Tui Blue Nausicaa to get exact prices for May 2025. Alternatively, check the Skyscanner links for flight prices to other destinations like Algarve or Crete.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, looking at the flight search results, there's a flight from Palermo to Heraklion for €175 in May 2025. But that's from Sicily to Crete, not from Germany... So maybe not relevant. The cheap flights to Malta from Germany via Eurowings seem more promising.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, the next steps should be:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Scrape Eurowings URL (https://www.eurowings.com/en/booking/offers/flights-from/DE/to/MT/2025-5.html) to confirm flight prices from Germany to Malta in May 2025. This would verify the €119.99 claim and check dates/times.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Scrape the TripAdvisor URL (https://www.tripadvisor.com/HotelsList-Europe-Beachfront-Cheap-Hotels-zfp13798233.html) for affordable beachfront hotels in Europe, focusing on Spain, Malta, Greece, etc., that are under €150/night. Specific hotels mentioned might include Tui Blue Nausicaa.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Scrape the Reddit URL (https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/zzzubk/where_to_go_in_may_for_sun_beach_culture_in/) for user recommendations on destinations with beaches, sun, and culture accessible without a car. This could help pinpoint specific cities like Valencia, Malaga, Barcelona, or Sicily towns.\n",
            "\n",
            "These three scrapes would give concrete flight and hotel options, plus validate the destinations suggested. From there, check if the total cost (flights + 3 nights hotel) stays under €2000. For example, a flight at €120 round trip and hotel at €150/night (totaling €450 for 3 nights) leaves plenty of budget for food and activities. Need to ensure the hotel is beachfront and in a warm location.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, considering temperature: May in Malta averages around 20-24°C according to some sources, Southern Spain (like Malaga, Costa del Sol) also around low 20s, which meets the warm requirement. Crete could be similar but maybe flights are more expensive. Algarve (Portugal) might be slightly cooler but still pleasant.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, after scraping, if the Eurowings flight is valid and the hotels are indeed available in the budget, then recommend Malta or Spain (like Malaga or Valencia) with specific hotels and flights. Alternatively, check Sicily if flights are affordable.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, the memory updates would include saving the scraped URLs as potential leads, adding information from the tool results, and tracking which hotels and flights are viable. Any contradictions, like a hotel not being beachfront or prices higher than expected, would require adjustment.\n",
            "\n",
            "Potential memory blocks to add: specific flight details from Eurowings once scraped, hotel options from TripAdvisor, and Reddit suggestions. Need to delete blocks that are no longer relevant once the data is confirmed.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, ensure that after scraping, the next steps would be to compile the options into a 3-day itinerary, checking that the total stays under €2000. For example, if flights are €250 round trip and hotels €150/night, that's €750 for hotels and €500 for flights (for two people?), but wait, the budget is per person? Wait, the user didn't specify the number of people. Assuming it's for one person? Or two? The task says \"Help me plan a 3 day holiday...\" so perhaps for one person, but needs to confirm. Since the budget is €2000 total, likely for one person, considering flights and hotel.\n",
            "\n",
            "But maybe splitting the budget: flights €200, hotels €450 (3 nights x €150), leaving €1350 for other expenses? That seems high. Wait, perhaps the user meant the total budget including everything (flights, hotel, food, activities) for under €2000. So flights and hotels must be within that. Therefore, flights and hotels should be as low as possible. So if flights are €120 return (Eurowings to Malta), and hotels at €150/night (€450), that totals €570 for flights and hotel. Remainder is for other expenses (food, transport, activities), which should be manageable within €2000.\n",
            "\n",
            "Therefore, the key is to confirm the flight and hotel prices from the sources given. Once confirmed, proceed to outline the itinerary. Any delays would require checking multiple sources or adjusting destinations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next tool calls: scrape Eurowings flight, TripAdvisor hotels, Reddit suggestions. Then, based on those results, proceed to fill in the details. Also, need to verify hotel proximity to the beach as per the user's requirement.\n",

            "Okay, let's tackle this holiday planning problem. The user wants a 3-day trip in Europe in May for under 2000 euros from Germany. They need flight and hotel recommendations, warm weather, and a beach nearby.\\n\\nFirst, looking at the current workspace. The memory blocks already have some potential destinations: Malta, Southern Spain, Sicily, Crete, Algarve. Also, there's a Eurowings flight lead to Malta at €119.99, and a hotel candidate in Malta that needs pricing confirmation. The Reddit thread mentions car-free coastal cities and beaches, which might be useful.\\n\\nThe tool results from scraping Eurowings showed flight options from various German airports to Malta. But maybe other destinations like Spain or Portugal are also worth checking. The TripAdvisor scrape didn't give specific Malta hotels but listed some destinations and categories. The Reddit scrape mentioned someone looking for similar destinations, but the full content isn't there. Probably need to focus on the destinations already identified.\\n\\nSo next steps: Verify Eurowings flights for Malta and maybe another destination. Check the hotel prices for the Tui Blue Nausicaa Beach hotel. Also, explore other destinations like Algarve or Valencia to compare prices and weather.\\n\\nWait, the user said May should be warm. May in Malta is around 20-25°C, which is good. Algarve in May is also warm. Southern Spain too. So narrowing down to these destinations.\\n\\nSince Eurowings flights to Malta are available, let's confirm the exact flight prices and dates. Also, check if the hotel in Malta is within budget. The initial flight price was €119.99, assuming round trip? Need to clarify. Maybe one-way? Wait, the user is in Germany, so probably round trip. If round trip is around €240, then hotel for 3 nights at €150 per night would be €450, totaling €690. That leaves around €1300 for other expenses, which is way under 2000. Maybe even consider slightly pricier hotels.\\n\\nBut wait, the user might need more specifics: exact flight dates, hotel links, maybe other costs like transport from airport to hotel, meals, etc. But the main budget constraints are flight and hotel. Since the user didn't ask for a full budget breakdown, just under 2000 for everything.\\n\\nNext tools to call: Scrape the Tui Blue Nausicaa hotel page to get pricing for May 2025. Also, search for flights from Germany to other destinations like Algarve or Valencia. Maybe check another airline for comparison. Also, check average May temperatures for these destinations to ensure they're warm enough.\\n\\nBut the existing memory blocks have flight leads for Malta and a hotel needing confirmation. Let's prioritize those. The TripAdvisor scrape didn't yield Malta hotels, so maybe another search for Malta hotels. Alternatively, check the specific hotel URL from the memory block mgz-786: https://www.tripadvisor.com/HotelsList-Europe-All_Inclusive-Cheap-Resorts-zfp13636521.html. Wait, that link is for all-inclusive resorts in Europe. The hotel name mentioned is Tui Blue Nausicaa Beach By Louis Hotels. So scraping that specific hotel's page to get the price.\\n\\nBut the tool result for the scrape on that TripAdvisor link showed some hotels but not the specific one. Maybe need a direct scrape of the Tui Blue Nausicaa's own website for accurate pricing.\\n\\nHowever, since the user's agent can only use the provided tools (search and scrape), and can't visit arbitrary URLs unless they are in memory. The current memory has mgz-786 with that TripAdvisor URL, but scraping it didn't find the hotel. So maybe that URL isn't the correct one. Alternatively, search for the hotel directly.\\n\\nWait, in the initial memory, mgz-786 says the hotel is on that TripAdvisor list, but the scrape result didn't show it. Maybe the hotel isn't listed there, so that's a dead end. Therefore, need to find another hotel source.\\n\\nAlternatively, use the search tool to look for \"Tui Blue Nausicaa Beach hotel Malta price May 2025\" but the search tool is for broader info. Maybe better to search for \"Malta beach hotels under 150 euro per night May 2025\" to find alternatives. Or use the scrape tool on the hotel's official website if the URL is known.\\n\\nBut the user's tools are limited. So possible next steps:\\n1. Search for average May temperatures in Malta, Algarve, Valencia, Crete to confirm warmth.\\n2. Search for flight prices from Germany to these destinations.\\n3. Scrape hotel websites for pricing.\\n\\nBut the user needs specific flight and hotel recommendations. Since Eurowings has a flight to Malta at €119.99, maybe that's a good starting point. Need to confirm if that's round trip or one-way. The initial memory block evk-006 mentions Eurowings offers Germany-Malta flights from €119.99 in May 2025. But the scrape result from that URL shows flight destinations, but not the actual price. So perhaps that €119.99 is outdated or needs verification.\\n\\nSo, perhaps use the search tool again for \"Eurowings flights Germany to Malta May 2025 price\" to get updated info. Alternatively, check other airlines like Ryanair, Lufthansa for prices.\\n\\nAlso, considering the hotel: if Tui Blue Nausicaa is too expensive, need alternatives. The TripAdvisor search didn't yield much, so maybe search for \"Malta beachfront hotels under 150 euro per night May 2025\".\\n\\nAnother consideration: the Reddit thread suggests car-free locations. Malta's public transport is decent, so maybe Valletta or Sliema area. But the user didn't mention car-free, just beach proximity.\\n\\nSo, next tool calls:\\n1. Scrape the specific hotel URL (mgz-786) again to check if it's available, but previous scrape didn't find it. Maybe that URL is not correct. So instead, search for the hotel directly.\\n2. Use search tool to find flights from Frankfurt to Malta in May 2025.\\n3. Use search tool to find hotels in Malta with beach access under €150/night.\\n\\nBut the agent can only make 3 tool calls per round. So prioritize:\\n- Search for \"May 2025 average temperature Malta Algarve Valencia Sicily Crete\" to confirm warmth.\\n- Search for \"Flights from Frankfurt to Malta May 2025 Eurowings\" for exact pricing.\\n- Scrape a specific hotel booking site for Malta hotels in the budget.\\n\\nWait, but scrape can only be done on URLs already found. The existing memory has some TripAdvisor links, but previous scrapes didn't find the hotel. Alternatively, the user agent might need to search for hotel booking sites and then scrape them.\\n\\nHmm. Let me structure the next steps based on the available tool results and memory.\\n\\nThe current tool results from Eurowings show multiple German airports to Malta, but no prices. So the initial evk-006 mentions a price, but the actual scrape didn't confirm it. Therefore, need to verify flight prices. Perhaps using search tool for exact flights.\\n\\nFor the hotel, since the initial TripAdvisor link didn't yield specifics, maybe search for \"Malta beach hotels under 150 euro May 2025\" to find URLs to scrape.\\n\\nAlso, check if other destinations like Algarve or Valencia have better deals. For example, flights to Faro (Algarve) or Valencia, then hotels there.\\n\\nBut to stay within 3 tool calls:\\n1. Search for \"Flights from Germany to Malta May 2025 prices\" to get updated flight options and costs.\\n2. Search for \"Malta beachfront hotels May 2025 under 150 euro per night\" to find potential hotels to scrape.\\n3. Search for \"Algarve May 2025 average temperature\" to compare warmth.\\n\\nOr prioritize confirming the Malta hotel first. Since the user wants specific recommendations, maybe focus on Malta as a primary destination given the existing leads.\\n\\nAfter gathering flight and hotel info for Malta, check if the total is under 2000. Assuming flights are around €240 round trip, hotel €450, leaving about 1300 for other expenses, which is well under. But need exact numbers.\\n\\nIn the memory updates, add the scraped flight info, even if it's just airports without prices. But since the initial evk-006 mentions a price, perhaps that's a lead but needs confirmation.\\n\\nSo next tool calls should be:\\n1. Use search tool to find current Eurowings flight prices from Germany to Malta in May 2025.\\n2. Use search tool to find beachfront hotels in Malta with prices around €150/night.\\n3. Scrape a specific hotel URL once found.\\n\\nBut since the agent can only make 3 tool calls, and the current scrape didn't yield hotel prices, maybe adjust.\\n\\nThe answer needs specific flight and hotel recommendations. Without concrete data, the agent can't proceed. So, steps:\\n- Confirm flight prices for Malta.\\n- Confirm hotel prices in Malta.\\n- Compare with other destinations if needed.\\n\\nTherefore, the next JSON response should call tools to get flight prices and hotel details. Also, check temperatures to ensure Malta is warm enough in May.\\n\\nSo tool calls:\\n1. Search for \"May 2025 average temperature Malta\" to confirm if warm enough.\\n2. Search for \"Eurowings flights Frankfurt to Malta May 2025 prices\" to get exact flight cost.\\n3. Search for \"Tui Blue Nausicaa Beach hotel Malta May 2025 price\" to confirm the hotel's cost.\\n\\nIf those searches return the necessary info, then the agent can compile the answer. Also, if temperatures are okay and flights and hotels are within budget, then status can be set to DONE.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the hotel is over budget, need to find alternatives.\\n\\nIn the current memory, after adding info from the tool results:\\n- The scrape of Eurowings showed multiple German airports but no prices. So the initial €119.99 might not be accurate. Need to verify.\\n- The TripAdvisor scrape didn't find the hotel, so need to search for it again.\\n- The Reddit post confirmed Malta as a potential destination but more info needed.\\n\\nSo updating memory with new info from tool results:\\n- The Eurowings scrape didn't provide prices, so the initial evk-006 block may be outdated. Maybe delete that block and replace with new info.\\n- The TripAdvisor scrape results didn't include the hotel, so need to find another source.\\n\\nTherefore, in memory updates, add new blocks for possible flight options and delete evk-006 if the price isn't confirmed. Then, add search queries for hotel prices.\\n\\nNow, drafting the JSON response:\\n\\nMemory updates: Add details from the tool results, but in the provided tool results, the Eurowings scrape didn't have prices. So maybe add that Eurowings flights from multiple German airports to Malta exist but pricing not listed. Then, plan to search for prices.\\n\\nTool calls:\\n1. Search for \"Eurowings flights Germany to Malta May 2025 prices\"\\n2. Search for \"Malta average temperature May\"\\n3. Search for \"Tui Blue Nausicaa Beach Hotel Malta May 2025 price\"\\n\\nThen, after getting those results, the agent can proceed. If the searches confirm the price and temperature, then recommend Malta with specific flights and hotel.\\n\\nBut the user's budget is under 2000, so as long as flights and hotel are around €700 total, it's feasible.\\n\\nIn the memory updates, also note that other destinations like Algarve or Crete could be alternatives if Malta doesn't work out, but prioritize the existing leads.\\n\\nThus, the JSON response would include adding memory blocks about the flight availability without prices, noting the need to check temperatures, and planning tool calls to get the missing data. Then, if all data is gathered, status can be DONE. Otherwise, continue.\\n\\nFinalizing the JSON:\\nMemory updates: Add that Eurowings has multiple departure airports but prices unconfirmed, delete the old evk-006 block if it's invalid. Add the need to check Malta's May temperature. Add search queries for hotel prices.\\nTool calls: The three searches mentioned above.\\nStatus remains IN_PROGRESS.\\n\n",
